Original Query:
SELECT project_members.latitude FROM project_members JOIN projects ON project_members.project = projects.unics_id WHERE projects.ec_call != 'H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD'
GPT-3 choices:
(0) Retrieve the latitude of project members, whose projects don't correspond to H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD
(1) Show all project members in projects that are not Single Stage RTD projects
(2) Find the latitude of the project members in projects which are not from the Single-Stage-RTD.
(3) Show all project members latitudes for projects that are not in the H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD context.
(4) Retrieve the latitude of project members in projects where the eucall is different than “H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD”
(5) What is the latitude of project members in projects which are not H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD
(6) Show me the latitude of project members from projects where the project leader is not from the H2020-SC1-2018-Single-Stage-RTD project
(7) Show the distances of all project members from projects with a short description (EC-fund code)
